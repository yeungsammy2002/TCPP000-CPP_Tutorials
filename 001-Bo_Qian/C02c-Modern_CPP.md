# Section 6 - Compiler Generated Functions

In the section of ***Compiler Generated Methods* (`C01b-Advanced_cpp.md`, Section 04)**, we have four methods that the compiler will generated if you don't declare them by yourself. So basically if you have a class `Dog`, and it looks empty. But it is not really empty, the compiler will generate some special methods for you:
```
class Dog{};
```
What we have talked about is for ***C++03***. It will generate methods:
1. ***Default constructor*** - The ***default constructor*** is not always generated. It is generated only if no constructor is declared by user.
2. ***Copy constructor***
3. ***Copy assignment operator***
4. ***Destructor***

Now we have ***C++11***, ***C++11*** has two more special methods that might be generated by the compiler, which are ***move constructor*** and ***move assignment operator***. ***C++11*** not only has added the two more compiler generated methods, it also have added more rules on how to generate those methods:
1. ***Default constructor***
2. ***Copy constructor*** - The ***copy constructor*** will **NOT** be generated if you have declared your own ***move constructor*** or ***move assignment operator***.
3. ***Copy assignment operator*** - The ***copy assignment operator*** will be generated only if ***move constructor*** or ***move assignment operator*** **NOT** declared by user.
4. ***Destructor***
5. ***Move constructor*** - The ***move constructor*** will **NOT** be generated if you have declared your own ***copy constructor***, or ***copy assignment operator***, or ***destructor***, or ***move assignment operator***.
6. ***Move assignment operator*** - The ***move assignment operator*** will be generated only if ***copy constructor***, or ***copy assignment operator***, or ***destructor***, or ***move constructor*** **NOT** declared by user.

So the generation of the ***move constructor*** and the ***move assignment operator*** is pretty restrictive. Most of the time, they will not be generated by compiler. In summary, what ***C++11*** has added to the picture is the ***move constructor*** and ***move assignment operator*** with some conditions.

This seemingly empty cast `Dog` is equivalent to something like this. A class `Dog` with ***default constructor***, ***copy constructor***, ***copy assignment operator***, ***destructor***, ***move constructor***, and ***move assignment operator***:
```
class Dog {
    // C++03:
    Dog();                          // default constructor
    Dog(const Dog&);                // copy constructor
    Dog& operator=(const Dog&);     // copy assignment operator
    ~Dog();                         // destructor

    // C++11:
    Dog(Dog&&);                     // move constructor
    Dog& operator=(Dog&&);          // move assignment operator
};
```

Having understand that, let's look at some examples. We have a class `Cat`, and `Cat` has a ***copy constructor***:
```
class Cat {
    Cat(const Cat&) {}      // copy constructor
};
```
What methods will be generated by the compiler for the `Cat` class? The ***default constructor*** will not be generated because we already have a constructor. The ***copy assignment operator*** and the ***destructor*** will be generated. The ***move constructor*** and the ***move assignment operator*** will be generated because the ***copy constructor*** is declared by user.

So the methods that will be generated for the `Cat` class are the ***copy assignment operator*** and the ***destructor***.


Now let's look at the second exmaple. We have a class `Duck`, and the `Duck` has a ***move constructor***.
```
class Duck {
    Duck(Duck&&) {}         // move constructor
}
```
What methods will be generated for the class `Duck`?
