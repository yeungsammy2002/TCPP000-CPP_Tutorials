# Overview

We'll talk about the recommended learning path, which I hope can make it easier for you to navigate the courses.

These courses are mostly targeted at the intermediate to advanced topic in C++. So if you have not learned C++ yet, you are recommended to start with some basic C++ tutorials. Once you have learned the basic and hopefully you had some real-life experience with C++. Then you could come back to my courses and learn more advanced topics.

There are different courses here:
1. **Advanced C++**
2. **Modern C++**
3. **C++ Standard Library**
4. **Concurrent Programming with C++11**
5. **Advanced STL**
6. **C++ Unit Test**
7. **Practical Programming Algorithms**
8. **Boost Library**


The first course that you might want to study is the ***Advanced C++*** course. This one covers the important topics that are applicable to both the ***old C++ standard*** and then the ***new C++ standard***, the ***C++11 standard***. There contains all very important topics in C++, so I do recommend you to watch everyone of them, except the last two sections - **Demystifying Operator `new`/`delete`** and **How to Define new Handler**, which covers the memory management, you can skip if you don't customize you memory management.

Then you can come back the **Modern C++** course. This course covers all the new features that has been introduced in ***C++11*** and ***C++14***. In the first run, you don't have to watch every section in this course. **You can only watch the first three sections**. These three sections give you a very basic introduction of the most important new features that introduced in ***C++11***.

Then I would recommend you to study ***C++ Standard Library*** course. This one talks part of the ***standard libaray*** that is introduced before ***C++11***, but they are also updated with the ***new C++11 feature***. All the topics in this course surrounds very basic element of the ***C++ standard library***. If you prefer, you could skip the ***C++ Stream*** sections in the first run, if you are not using ***stream*** at all.

And after that, I would recommand you to go back to the ***Modern C++*** course, and then finish the rest of it. The rest of the ***Modern C++*** course covers both the new language features and the new libraries that have been introduced in ***C++11***.

After that, you can go to any courses that you are interested here. I believe there is no more dependency among the remaining courses. You can study ***Concurrent Programming with C++11***, ***Advanced STL***, ***C++ Unit Test***, ***Practical Programming Algorithms***, ***Boost Library***... anyone you like.

So, to summarize the sequence:
1. **Advanced C++**
2. **Modern C++: Section 1 ~ 3**
3. **C++ Standard Library**
4. **Modern C++: the rest**
5. **Boost, Unit Test, Algorithms, Concurrent Programming, Advanced STL**
